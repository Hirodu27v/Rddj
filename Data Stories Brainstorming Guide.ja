THE SEVEN TYPES OF DATA STORIES

Contrast: An apples to apples contrast of one metric, especially the min and max or the top versus the bottom of a metric. Comparing countries, states, races/ethnicities, sports teams. You can also compare totals to rates to show these differences.

Intersections: In a change over time metric, an intersection shows when one line “catches up” or passes another. To help identify these, you can think about outside events that would drastically impact a metric.

Factors: Looking at a whole pie (like people in the U.S.) and then different slices that make up that pie such as different races or genders. Also, factors inside different metrics, especially scores, for example the statistics that make-up how a football player is scored ahead or a draft.

Outliers: Things that are very different from the rest of the category. You can evaluate outliers by looking at the median and the spread of the data.
